# My Portfolio of Websites over the years
This page can both be seen in its standard text form on GitHub.com: [https://github.com/beebus/beebus.github.io](https://github.com/beebus/beebus.github.io)
Or it can be viewed in its intended form as a GitHub Page, utilizing the CSS stylizing aspects of YAML here: [https://beebus.github.io/](https://beebus.github.io/)

I based this first GitHub Page from the ideas presented on the following website. 
[https://help.github.com/en/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages](https://help.github.com/en/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages)
If you are having trouble with the formatting of the .md files, I recommend this page which helped me out to remember some of those odd rules!
[https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

This particular page I created uses a combination of:
* MD file for static, text-based pages in GitHub, like README.md files.
* Jekyll, which is actually written in Ruby, so anytime you work with GitHub Pages, you'll probably see some .rb files and Gemfile.
  * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(software)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(software))
  * [https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)
  * [https://jekyllrb.com/](https://jekyllrb.com/)

* Python

* YAML (seen as both .yml and .yaml files) I had always heard them referred to as configuration files, but according to Wikipedia and other websites, YAML (Yet Another Multicolumn Layout) "is a cross-browser CSS framework".

Here, I will be compiling the different types of websites, database systems, and other applications that I have worked on over the years. This is to give a representation of some of the work I can do.
