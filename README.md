# Portfolio of the [Websites](https://beebus.github.io) I've made
I based this first GitHub Page from the ideas presented on the following website. 
[https://help.github.com/en/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages](https://help.github.com/en/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages)

This particular page I created uses a combination of:
* Jekyll, which is actually written in Ruby, so anytime you work with GitHub Pages, you'll probably see some .rb files and Gemfile.
  * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(software)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(software))
  * [https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)
  * [https://jekyllrb.com/](https://jekyllrb.com/)

* Python

* YAML (seen as both .yml and .yaml files) I had always heard them referred to as configuration files, but according to Wikipedia and other websites, YAML (Yet Another Multicolumn Layout) "is a cross-browser CSS framework".
  * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML_(framework)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML_(framework))
  * [https://github.com/yamlcss/yaml](https://github.com/yamlcss/yaml)
  * [http://www.yaml.de/](http://www.yaml.de/)


Here, I will be compiling the different types of websites, database systems, and other applications that I have worked on over the years. This is to give a representation of some of the work I can do.
